<p>After a workout your body will need 10 grams of essential amino acids in one sitting to maximize your muscle building and repair, and it needs to be taken with carbs (about 1.5 g x your weight in kg) within 30 minutes after completing your workout. It has been shown that muscle protein synthetic rate (mps) is elevated in humans by 50% at 4 hrs following a bout of heavy resistance training, and by 109% at 24 hrs following training. Meaning you are metabolically active because of the increased muscle mass. Whey protein is a milk protein that your body absorbs quickly, making it useful before or after your workout.</p>
<h3 id="this-will-prevent-your-body">This will prevent your body.</h3><p>It starts protein synthesis during rather than after your training session. For example, in one 2013 study published in the journal of physiology, men performed resistance exercise and followed up their workout by consuming 80 grams of protein over the next 12 hours. Lean cuts of beef or pork; Or eggs and egg substitutes. Meaning you are metabolically active because of the increased muscle mass. Taken alone or as part of a complete protein, bcaas inhibit muscle breakdown.</p>
